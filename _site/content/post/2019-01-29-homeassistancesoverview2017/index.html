<p>I found a funny article in Twitter <a href="https://thebolditalic.com/you-are-now-fully-optimized-716f4" title="https://thebolditalic.com/you-are-now-fully-optimized-716f4">https://thebolditalic.com/you-are-now-fully-optimized-716f4</a><a href="https://thebolditalic.com/you-are-now-fully-optimized-716f482b17f5?fbclid=IwAR0CUrLYt_9wErlJerN5Qa1dBSy_-qb_bpi6-a37t2VrXknfxNKsSEO9SnQ">…</a> about IOT, Software engineers life and automation. Btw, see @lyashenkogs. So I was interested how it’s going with home assistances now.</p>

<p>Time to time I use Google assistance on my Xiomi Mi Max to translate something to Russian, check the weather, convert currency, look at nearest events in a calendar, build a direction on a map or just google for some technical or not very term. <br />
The biggest cons - this doesn’t work from a locked screen on a smartphone, except you are Google Pixel owner ($649 for a basic version).</p>

<p>So for me, it will be good to have a home assistance like GA but on a MacBook.</p>

<p><strong>Why I don’t consider Google Home as an option.</strong><br />
No screen -&gt; no visual output or possibility to open a wiki article for example<br />
1. No keyboard in case if need to input a request manually<br />
2. A highly proprietary system with no clean way to integrate with<br />
3. There is no SDK for Google Home as a device. <br />
4. When developing custom action you are locked with google infrastructure and firebase. <a href="https://developers.google.com/actions/get-started/" title="https://developers.google.com/actions/get-started/">https://developers.google.com/actions/get-started/</a></p>

<p><strong>Amazon Echo</strong><br />
I didn’t use Echo but seems like it doesn’t work well with Google services out of the box. Developing Alexa skills involves AWS Lambda so I can get a vendor lock eventually. I’m sure there are workarounds, but I don’t see some very popular ones.<br />
A website when you can try Alexa online <a href="https://echosim.io/" title="https://echosim.io/">https://echosim.io/</a> didn’t work for mine. I wasn’t able even to trigger some basic functionality!</p>

<p>Siri<br />
Very limited. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/" title="https://9to5mac.com/">https://9to5mac.com/</a><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/06/14/how-siri-works-in-ios-10-for-third-party-apps-rich-integration-with-six-kinds-of-application/?fbclid=IwAR2owf457Q7QB3ZCZ0GHtl_Lpd8oQOfGbckP5DuVbWVc4NfqTS19kDqwZrQ">…/how-siri-works-in-ios-10-for-third-p…/</a></p>

<p><strong>Ok Google on MacBook</strong><br />
Hopefully, I found a video with detailed instructions how to use OK Google from a MacBook using voice, and it worked for me. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7dYKFukPfo" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7dYKFukPfo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7dYKFukPfo</a></p>

<p>What it does and doesn’t <br />
It does everything except triggering actions like playing music, adding events to a calendar or reminders. In this case, you need GA which doesn’t have an official desktop version. Only an API or an SDK<a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/overview" title="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/overview">https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/overview</a> which will eventually look like a console app <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UINBWxs6SeI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UINBWxs6SeI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UINBWxs6SeI</a></p>

<p><strong>MacAssistant</strong><br />
Technically, it’s a Swift based wrapper, suspiciously similar to Siri, with very limited functions and bugs. Also, it requires macOS Sierra. I think the idea is great, but implementation has a lot of work to do yet. <br />

<p><strong>Open source solutions</strong><br />
I didn’t test it yet. And it’s written in javascript. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEnu-aotG2s" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEnu-aotG2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEnu-aotG2s</a>. <a href="https://github.com/TheAdrianProject/AdrianSmartAssistant" title="https://github.com/TheAdrianProject/AdrianSmartAssistant">https://github.com/TheAdrianProject/AdrianSmartAssistant</a></p>

<p>Even Mark Zuckerberg build own home assistance. Yeh yeh, without any other engineers) and surprisingly there is no open source code) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvimBPJ3XGQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvimBPJ3XGQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvimBPJ3XGQ</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
I think there is no proper desktop home assistant for mere mortals yet. All market solutions seem beta versions and are very vendor specific. Personally, I will wait till something proper appeared at market and use GA as it is now from a smartphone and a MacBook.</p>

<p>p.s I will appreciate any kind of constructive critics about the article or yours ideas about home assistances in practice.</p>
